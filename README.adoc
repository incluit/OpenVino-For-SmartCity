== Foreword
This is a follow-up on the OpenVino's inference tutorials:

https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/inference-tutorials-generic/tree/openvino_toolkit_r4_0

We will work on and extend this tutorial as a demo app for smart cities,
specifically for near misses detection.

== Introduction

This project consists on showcasing the advantages of the Intel's OpenVINO toolkit. We will develop a __Near Misses__ case scenario, where we will detect vehicles and pedestrian and estimate a metric of a crossroad's dangerousness. For that, we will use the OpenVINO toolkit and OpenCV, all written in `{cpp}`.

As mentioned previously, we will take the https://github.com/intel-iot-devkit/inference-tutorials-generic/tree/openvino_toolkit_r4_0/car_detection_tutorial/step_4[step 4] as a starting point, as it provides us with the options to run and stack different models synchronously or asynchronously. Once the proper models for vehicle and pedestrian detection are defined, we proceed to develop a feature to let the user define the different areas of interest (in this case, sidewalks and streets) that will help in identifying dangerous situations later on. Then, we will work on object tracking to recognize the same object across successive frames, giving us the ability to estimate trajectories, speeds and positions of the objects. Finally, we will have to define what are considered __dangerous situations__ and check that the system detects them correctly.

== Build

**1.** Clone the repository at desired location:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/incluit/OpenVino-For-SmartCity.git
----

**2.** The first step is to configure the build environment for the OpenCV
toolkit by sourcing the "setupvars.sh" script.

[source,bash]
----
source  /opt/intel/computer_vision_sdk/bin/setupvars.sh
----

**3.** Change to the top git repository:

[source,bash]
----
cd OpenVino-For-SmartCity
----

**4.** Create a directory to build the tutorial in and change to it.

[source,bash]
----
mkdir build
cd build
----

**5.** Compile:

[source,bash]
----
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../
make
----

== Usage

=== Run

**1.** Before running each of the following sections, be sure to source the
helper script. That will make it easier to use environment variables
instead of long names to the models:

[source,bash]
----
source ../scripts/setupenv.sh 
----

=== CPU

**1.** First, let us see how it works on a single image file using default
synchronous mode.

[source,bash]
----
./intel64/Release/smart_city_tutorial -m_vp $vehicle232 -i ../data/car_1.bmp
----

**2.** For video files:

[source,bash]
----
./intel64/Release/smart_city_tutorial -m $mVDR32 -m_p $person232 -i ../data/video1_640x320.mp4
----

**3.** You can also run the command in asynchronous mode using the option
"-n_async 2":

[source,bash]
----
./intel64/Release/smart_city_tutorial -m $mVDR32 -m_p $person232 -i ../data/video1_640x320.mp4 -n_async 2
----

**4.** You can also load the models into the GPU or MYRIAD:

**Note**: In order to run this section, the GPU and/or MYRIAD are required to be present and correctly configured.

[source,bash]
----
./intel64/Release/smart_city_tutorial -m_vp $vehicle232 -d_vp GPU -i ../data/video1_640x320.mp4
----

[source,bash]
----
./intel64/Release/smart_city_tutorial -m_vp $vehicle232 -d_vp MYRIAD -i ../data/video1_640x320.mp4
----

=== Other models

You can also experiment by using different detection models, being the ones available up to now:

. person-vehicle-bike-detection-crossroad-0078
** `-m_vp $vehicle2{16,32}`
. vehicle-detection-adas-0002 together with person-detection-retail-0013 or pedestrian-detection-adas-0002:
** `-m $mVDR{16,32}` and `-m_p $person{1,2}{16,32}`
. frozen_yolo_v3
** `-m_y $yolo16`

By default they will be loaded into the CPU, so remember to pass the corresponding argument:
** `-d_vp {CPU,GPU,MYRIAD}`
** `-d {CPU,GPU,MYRIAD}` and `-d_p {CPU,GPU,MYRIAD}`
** `-d_y {CPU,GPU,MYRIAD}`

The first 2 are included with the OpenVINO toolkit, while the last one is the compiled version of the public https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet[yolo] general detection model. You can do this yourself by following this https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/OpenVINO-Using-TensorFlow[Intel's guide] or download our compiled http://bit.ly/2QN2TT7[binary] and http://bit.ly/2sw4Idn[xml]. You will need to move these files to the **data** directory inside your OpenVino-For-SmartCity path.

=== Tracking

To enable tracking you should run the command with the `-tracking` argument:

[source,bash]
----
./intel64/Release/smart_city_tutorial -m_vp $vehicle232 -d_vp GPU -i ../data/video1_640x320.mp4 -n_async 16
----

image::https://github.com/incluit/OpenVino-For-SmartCity/blob/master/images/tracking.gif[detection]

=== Performance

**Note**: In order to run this section, the GPU is required to be present and correctly configured.

While **person-vehicle-bike-detection-crossroad-0078** and **frozen_yolo_v3** detect better in most cases, they have the disadvantage of being too slow for processing, achieving 20 fps and 8 fps respectively. On the other hand, if we can use 2 lighter models to detect different objects, we can parallelize the processing in different devices and take advantage of the asynchronous mode, as follows:

**1.** First we run in synchronous mode then asynchronous with increasing -n_async values using the commands:

[source,bash]
----
./intel64/Release/smart_city_tutorial -m $mVDR16 -d {CPU,GPU} -m_p $person232 -d_p {GPU,CPU} -i ../data/video1_640x320.mp4 -n_async 1
./intel64/Release/smart_city_tutorial -m $mVDR16 -d {CPU,GPU} -m_p $person232 -d_p {GPU,CPU} -i ../data/video1_640x320.mp4 -n_async 2
./intel64/Release/smart_city_tutorial -m $mVDR16 -d {CPU,GPU} -m_p $person232 -d_p {GPU,CPU} -i ../data/video1_640x320.mp4 -n_async 4
./intel64/Release/smart_city_tutorial -m $mVDR16 -d {CPU,GPU} -m_p $person232 -d_p {GPU,CPU} -i ../data/video1_640x320.mp4 -n_async 8
./intel64/Release/smart_city_tutorial -m $mVDR16 -d {CPU,GPU} -m_p $person232 -d_p {GPU,CPU} -i ../data/video1_640x320.mp4 -n_async 16
----

**2.** Asynchronous mode should be faster by some amount for `-n_async 2` then a little more for `-n_async 4` and `-n_async 8`, then not as noticeable for `-n_async 16`. The improvements come from the CPU running in parallel more and more with the GPU. The absence of improvement shows when the CPU is doing less in parallel and is waiting on the other devices. This is referred to as “diminishing returns” and will vary across devices and inference models.

**3.** We run a performance analysis by running each 9 combinations of model/device/precision. The following graph shows the results:

image::https://github.com/incluit/OpenVino-For-SmartCity/blob/master/images/Vehicle%20and%20Pedestrian%20detection%20performance.png[performance]

=== Observations on Models and Performance

While the 2 light combined models work way faster than the heavy single ones, they're restricted in terms of perspective, making them unavailable for most use cases where the camera is not positioned in a way that they can detect properly. That is why we recommend using any of the other 2 for further implementations and analysis.
